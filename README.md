# Code for *A Thalamus–Brainstem Attractor Network Drives History-Biased Decisions*

This repository contains code related to the paper:

> **A Thalamus–Brainstem Attractor Network Drives History-Biased Decisions**

The code provided here focuses on the **model simulation part** of the study.  
All scripts are implemented in Python (Jupyter notebooks) and are organized for reproducing specific analyses and visualizations of neural activity trajectories.

## Contents

- **`trajectory_plot.ipynb`**  
  Code for plotting average neural activity trajectories across different conditions.

- **`tranInh_trial_plot.ipynb`**  
  Code for analyzing and plotting trial-level inhibitory/transfer dynamics.

- **`example_trial_plot.ipynb`**  
  Example script showing single-trial activity and plotting pipeline.

## Notes

- These scripts represent the **model simulation component** of the paper.  
- The folder structure may evolve as additional scripts and analysis modules are included.  
- Dependencies: Python 3.11, Jupyter Notebook, NumPy, Matplotlib, BrainPy (and other standard scientific Python packages).
